# GAC.Calculator
This is going to be a python based app for calculating banners for Grand Arena Championships (GACs) in the mobile game Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes (swgoh).
I'm still in early development stages for it, working out the algorithms and such.

I plan to update this description as I reach certain milestones in the development. For more incremental changes, check the version history for main.py.
